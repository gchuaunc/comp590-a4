## Project details

I wanted to keep things simple and lay some groundwork for future Quest projects. A key functionality in many VR games is the ability to point at objects to grab them. I wanted to see if I could implement this from scratch.

In this demo / proof of concept, players can point at any grabbable object using the right controller and press the index trigger button to pick it up and hold it, and then upon letting go of the trigger, will let go of the object with the same velocity they are moving their hand.
